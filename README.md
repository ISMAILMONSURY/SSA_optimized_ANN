# SSA_optimized_ANN
This project aims to solve the problem of local minima in an artificial neural network by implementing sparrow search algorithm as a weight and bias optimization technique and solve the problem of getting trapped in local minima of the optimization process. The model was generated to predict the plate end debonding of FRP-strength RC beams. Due to skewness and data range variability problem, model is getting trapped into local minima issue with poor optimization. Hence, SSA algorithm is implemented in ANN to solve the problem and increase the efficacy of the prediction model.
